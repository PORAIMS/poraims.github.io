                        <p class="mgBtMd">
                            The history of industrial automation reveals a strong link between advancements in automation methods and global economic shifts. Industrial robots, which became distinct tools in the 1960s, along with technologies like CAD and CAM, have driven transformations in manufacturing automation. These systems have paved the way for ongoing, unpredictable changes in how industries operate. In North America, the adoption of robots surged in the early 1980s before slowing briefly, yet has grown steadily since. Robotics now plays a critical role in manufacturing, largely due to declining costs and enhanced capabilities, allowing companies to cut labor expenses significantly.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mgBtBig">
                            Industrial robots have revolutionized manufacturing by performing tasks that are not only cost-effective but also safer and sometimes impossible for humans. The cost of robotic technology is dropping, while the price of human labor rises, making robots an appealing choice for industrial tasks. By 2025, robots are projected to reduce labor costs by 16% on average. Historically, robots date back to ancient Greece, but industrial robotics took off with the introduction of Unimate in 1961, the first industrial robot used on General Motors' assembly line. Since then, robots have continuously evolved, positioning automation as a cornerstone of modern industry.

                        <h3 class="mgBtMd"><span>1.2 </span> WHAT IS ROBOT</h3>
                        <p class="mgBtMd">Despite the growing integration of robots into various fields, including healthcare, there is no universally accepted definition that covers all forms of robots.</p>
                        <p class="mgBtSm">Generally, a robot is considered a mechanical or virtual agent, often with electromechanical components, that is programmed via a computer system. The programming allows it to perform tasks in a way that may appear as if it has independent intentions or represents a human agent. While this description is broad, it highlights several key features that many robots share:</p>
                        <ol class="subp">
                            <li class="mgBtSm"><span class="bold">Artificially Constructed: </span>Robots are non-natural entities, either physical or virtual, created through engineering.</li>
                            <li class="mgBtSm"><span class="bold">Environmental Perception: </span>Many robots possess sensors that allow them to understand and react to their surroundings.</li>
                            <li class="mgBtSm"><span class="bold">Interaction with the Environment: </span>They often have the ability to manipulate objects or navigate within a space.</li>
                            <li class="mgBtMd"><span class="bold">Programmability and Intelligence: </span>Robots can be reprogrammed and may demonstrate varying levels of intelligence.</li>
                            </ol>
                        <p class="mgBtMd">From a more standardized perspective, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 8373) defines an industrial robot as "an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator, programmable in three or more axes, which can be either stationary or mobile" and is primarily used in automation applications.</p>
                        <p class="mgBtBig">For the medical applications context, it’s also relevant to mention service robots. Unlike industrial robots, service robots are designed to interact with humans and assist with healthcare, rehabilitation, and surgery. This category often includes robotic systems that provide high precision and aid in minimally invasive procedures, making them crucial in modern medical sciences.</p>

                                    <p class="mgBtSm">The end-effector is a critical component in robotic manipulators, functioning as the "tool" or "hand" of the robot. In the context of medical robotics, end-effectors are highly specialized to meet the unique demands of various medical applications, ranging from surgical tools to rehabilitation devices. An end-effector is the device attached to the distal end of a robotic manipulator, designed to interact directly with the task environment. The type of end-effector used is typically tailored to the specific application and can include:</p>
